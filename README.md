Layla were created using the Unity3D Game Engine
### How To Create a New Scene and Environment
1. Create and develop your scene in your own project. (Use Unity Version 2019.4.X.X) 
2. Decide in which category you want to create a scene. Then create one new scene.
3. Delete Maincamera.
4. Add  `OvrCameraRig.prefab` to Hierarchy. This prefab includes Darker Effect, some particle effects(virtual breahing etc.) UI(loading screen, mood tracker, rating panel and finish panel).
5. Desing and/or develop your original scene.
6. You can add our ready-mate exercises to your own scene. [Prefabs](https://www.exampleprefab.com)
7. Add Addressables library(Addressable Version 1.19.11.) to your unity project. This is very important. Otherwise there may be problems loading the scenes.
8. Build the scene with Addressable Default Build.
9. Addressables will give 4 files (two .bundle, one json and hash file)
10. Upload these 4 files to the website respectively.

### Concepst And Categories
- Decide what category your target scene will be in. There are 3 category offers from the team but you can feel free either to add a new category or contribute a stage in one existing category.
1. *Calm* 
2. *Focus* 
3. *Excitement*

- Be careful not to be too similar to scenes that have been made before. <br/>
- Make sure the gameplay length is longer than 3 minutes and less than 12 minutes.
### Avoid doing these
- Don't change any ready prefabs, you can use it in your scene but never change it.
- Don't call at any time  `Application.Quit()` `SceneManager.LoadScene()` `SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync()`
- Don't delete or modify any files in the project
- Don't use coptright audios, logos , 3D models and any assets.
- Don't use canvas and UI objects.
